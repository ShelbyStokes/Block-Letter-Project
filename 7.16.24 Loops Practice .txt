#Prompt: 1. Create a list called single_digits that consists of the numbers 0-9 (inclusive).
# Your code below:
single_digits = list(range(0,10))
print(single_digits)
#Create a for loop that goes through single_digits and prints out each one.

# for digit in single_digits:
#   print(digit) 

#3.Before the loop, create a list called squares. Assign it to be an empty list to begin with.

# squares = []

#4.Inside the loop that iterates through single_digits, append the squared value of each element of single_digits to the list squares. You can do this before or after printing the element.
#5.After the for loop, print out squares.

squares = []
for digit in single_digits:
  print(digit) 
  squares.append(digit**2)
print(squares)

#6.Create the list cubes using a list comprehension on the single_digits list. Each element of cubes should be an element of single_digits taken to the third power.
#7. Print cubes.

cubes = [digit**3 for digit in single_digits]
print(cubes)
